# hello-world
Hello, World!

Yes, you've heard it a million times by now, that simple two-word introductory phrase.

A programmer who has never typed the words "Hello, World!" in some form or another 
has performed an impressive feat that few among us can claim. 

Nor should one want to claim ownership of that achievement, really; 
Hello World has become as much a part of every programmer as the semicolon has. 

It is a rite of passage with every new language.

Don't be afraid to say hello to the world --
you may discover it is saying hello right back at you.
